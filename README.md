How to create a simple website using HTML and CSS that plays an MP3 file as background music

In this example, we're using the background-image CSS property to set the background image of the webpage to background-image.jpg, which should be located in the same directory as the HTML file. We're also setting the font family and text color of the body to white.

Next, we're using the audio HTML element to embed an MP3 file (music.mp3) as background music. We've set the loop attribute to make the audio repeat, and autoplay attribute to make the audio start playing automatically when the page loads. We've also hidden the audio element using CSS (display: none;) so that it doesn't take up any space on the page.

Finally, we're adding some sample text to the page using h1 and p elements.

Note: It's generally not recommended to use HTML and CSS in the same file. It's better to separate them into different files to improve readability and maintainability.
